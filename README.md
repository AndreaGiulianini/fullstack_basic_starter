# Basic Starter for Next.js(AppRouter) - Typescript - ReduxTLK - Fastify - Sequelize - Docker

This a small toy project that I prepared to give some exercises to new colleagues who are approaching web development for the first time, so I can give them a starting point that allows me over time to be able to explain everything to them.

To start the project on Docker launch the file './start.bat' on windows, on other operating systems just copy paste the contents of the file

To populate the database container launch the file './reset_db.bat'
