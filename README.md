# Basic Starter for Next.js(AppRouter) - Shadcn - Typescript - ReduxTLK - Fastify - Drizzle - Docker

This a small toy project that I prepared to give some exercises to new colleagues who are approaching web development for the first time, so I can give them a starting point that allows me over time to be able to explain everything to them.

To start the project on Docker launch the file './start.sh'

To populate the database container launch the file './populate.sh'

# What missing

 - Example for transaction(https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/transactions#transactions)
 - Implement Auth(https://lucia-auth.com/sessions/basic-api/drizzle-orm)
